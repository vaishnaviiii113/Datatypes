# Datatypes

DATATYPES: It is a categories of values.

Two types of Datatypes:

Immutable And Mutable

Immutable has string, numeric and tuple(cant be change after created)

Mutable has set, lists, dictionary (can be change after created)

Strings: It is sequence of characters.

OPERATIONS

a) Concatenation: Joining of two or more strings together.

b)Replication: Repetition of single string.

c)Indexing : Gets the index of characters or alphabet in the string

d)Slicing : Gets the specific part of string

METHODS

a)Find- This method is used to search an index of a letter.

b)Upper- Converts string into upper case.

c)Lower-Converts string into lower case.

d)Capitalize-capitalize the first word of first word.

e)Swap case- It changes capital letter to small and small letter to capital.

f)Replace-It replace the given word with another.

g)Count- it is used to count the number of occurance of specified object.

h)Split-It is used to split the string into words with specified character and return a list.

i)Format-Used to make change in a string explicitly.

j)Startswith- It is used to check whether the string starts with specified character and returns boolean value as an output.

k)Endswith- It is used to check whether the string ends with specified characters and return boolean value as an output.

l)rstrip- Removes the white space from the right side of the string

m)lstrip-Removes the white space from the left side of the string

n)Strip- Removes the white spaces from both the sides

o)Join- Use to join every elements present inside the iterable with string and return a complete string.

p)Center-Use to keep the string at center of the given length.

q)Title-it capitalize the every first letter of all the words in string, rest other will be small.



Tuple

It is the collection of homogenous and heterogenous values separated by comas(,) and surrounded by round brackets() and it is Immutable datatype.

OPERATIONS:

CONCATENATION : Joining of two or more tuple together.

REPLICATION: Repetition of single tuple.

INDEXING : It is used to get the index of characters or alphabet in the tuple.

SLICING: It is used to get the specific part of the tuple.

METHODS:

COUNT :It is used to count the number of specified object.

INDEX: Finds the first occurrence of the specified value.


LIST

It is group of sequence of values of similar or different datatype that are separated by (,)comma and surrounded by square brackets[].

Values present in the lists are called as items or elements.

The indexes starts from 0.

List is mutable i.e it can be modified.

Operations:

Concatenation : It is an operation where the element of one list is added at the end of the another list.

Replication: Repetition of single list.

Indexing: Gets an index of character or alphabets in the list.

Slicing: Gets the specific part of list.

Methods:

Append(x.append ()): Append use to add the value at the end of the list of only takes one argument.

Extend(x.extend()): Merge to different list together.

Remove(x.remove()): Deletes the specific elements.

Pop(x.pop()): Deletes elements by index.

Count(x.count()): Counts the number of elements present in list.

Index(x.index()): Give the index number of specific elements.

Insert(x.insert()): Add the element in the list at specific index.

Reverse(x.reverse()): Use to reverse the list.

Sort(x.sort()): Sort the list in ascending and descending order.

Join(x.join()): Join a specific value with every elements of list and returns a string.



Dictionary

It is collections of key values surrounded by {}and separated by commas(,).

Dictionaries are mutable and they are unordered.

Operations

Add: It adds values in the dictionary.

Update : Helps to update values in the dictionaries

Retrieve : use to retrieve the value of a given key from a dictionary.

Methods:

Key : This method gives the keys present in the dictionaries.

Values: This method gives the values present in the dictionaries.

Update: Updates the value of key present in the dictionary.

Item : It is the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.

Pop: Deletes the key-value present in the dictionary.

Get : Helps to get the value for specific key.

Set default : It helps to add a new key-value in the dictionary.



Sets:

Unordered collection of items.

In sets, every elements are unique .

Operations:

Union (|) : Contains all the elements of both the sets.

Intersection(&): Contain all the common elements present in both the sets.

Difference(-): difference between the number of elements in two sets.

Methods:

Add : Add a value into a set and it takes only one argument.

Remove: Deletes the value from set.

Pop: It is index based removal. Removes the first value from set.
